# Privacy Policy — Learning Copilot

**Last Updated:** January 2, 2025

---

## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how **Aisystant** ("we", "us", "our") processes information when you use the Learning Copilot app in ChatGPT (the "Service").

Learning Copilot is an AI-powered learning companion. The Service is delivered via ChatGPT and uses an Aisystant-hosted MCP server to provide tools and responses.

---

## 2. Data We Process

### 2.1 Data Processed by OpenAI / ChatGPT

When you use the Service in ChatGPT, OpenAI processes your chats and any files you share in accordance with OpenAI's policies and retention rules. Chats are saved until you delete them; deleted chats are scheduled for permanent deletion within 30 days, subject to limited legal/security exceptions.

See [OpenAI's Chat and File Retention Policies](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8983778-chat-and-file-retention-policies-in-chatgpt).

### 2.2 Data We Receive When Our MCP Tools Are Called

When ChatGPT invokes our MCP tools, we receive only the information required to execute the tool call, which may include:

| Data Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Tool Call Parameters** | Selected tool name and structured inputs |
| **User-Provided Content** | Relevant content necessary to complete the request (e.g., a learning goal or task details) |
| **Technical Metadata** | Request ID, timestamps, and other data required for operation |

We do not require you to create an Aisystant account to use the current version of the Service.

### 2.3 Operational Logs

To keep the Service reliable and secure, we may collect minimal operational logs (e.g., error traces, response codes, timestamps).

- **Retention:** Up to 30 days
- These logs are not used to build marketing profiles

---

## 3. How We Use Your Data

We use data we receive to:

- Execute MCP tool calls and return results to ChatGPT
- Provide learning guidance and recommendations in the conversation
- Maintain security, prevent abuse, and troubleshoot reliability issues

---

## 4. Data Storage & Retention

- We do not store full conversation transcripts on Aisystant-controlled servers. Chat content is retained by OpenAI as described in their retention policy.
- If operational logs are enabled, we retain them for the period stated in Section 2.3 and then delete or aggregate them.

---

## 5. Data Sharing

We do not sell personal data. We may share data only:

- **With OpenAI** — as necessary to provide the Service inside ChatGPT
- **With infrastructure providers** — (e.g., Cloudflare for hosting) solely to operate the Service
- **If required by law** — to comply with legal obligations

---

## 6. International Data Transfers

Because the Service operates through ChatGPT, data may be processed by OpenAI and transferred internationally according to OpenAI's practices. Please review [OpenAI's Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy) for details.

## 7. Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict processing of your personal data.
